BlockChain , Cryptography , NFT , Decentralization , Defi , DAO , 


Each block record some data

Each block link to-gather with crypto Graphy

When data changes the has of the block chain also change

Block chain is immutable and distributed

Each computer contains full copy of the block chain when new block is added it send to all the others computers as well


Each block is made of 3 parts 

Data (The date which we store on block chain is transactions whose transfer ownership from one person to other person)

Has of this block

Hash of the previous block

Hash is like a finger print


Janases Block : The block that start the whole chain 


Immutability : Once a piece of data added in block chain is there forever 


Distributed block chain :


Distributed ledger


DAPPS : 

DAOS : 

BlockChain consensus : way of getting agreament on the block chain network to add new block chain block

1 BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshis


Transactions are first recorded in journal and then in Ledger



We need to look throw block chain and its transactions to get the current balances for every body using this block chain

What are nonce : 

Proof of work vs proof of stack


Nonce = number only used once

Hash of the block is 64 character hexa-decimal number


Blocks are cryptographically linked together


Main concepts of block chain are:
1) Mining 2) Hash Cryptography 3) Distributed p2p network 4) immutable Ledger

What are orphaned Block



Smart contract is one application of block chain


SHA256

Any has algorithm has 5 key properties:

One way => has to data is not possible

Deterministic => for same input out will be same

Fast computation => take less time

Withstand collisions => not possible or impossible to have same output for same data

Avalanche effect => for small input change the complete input


What is AirDrop NFT and lazy minting

Block chain is distributed and using p2p network 


What is coin vs token in cryotourrency



Mineable cryptocurrency are crypt currency where you calm ownership some amount of new coins just by contributing to the creation of new node to the blockChain this is how bitcoin works

Not mineable cryptocurrency <=> example ripple (XRP coin)


Federated Decentralization model vs Absolute decentralization model
