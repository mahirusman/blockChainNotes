Dependency Injection is a design pattern where the dependencies of a component are created from outside
rather then being created or manages by the component itself.
the two common ways to mange Dependency injuction is :
constructor Injection or setter injuction

in nodejs application we make one base class with general CRUD and then when we call that class we provide instance
of the model on which we want to perform CRUD


class CRUDService {
  constructor(model) {
    this.model = model;
  }

  async create(data) {
    const document = new this.model(data);
    return document.save();
  }

  async read(query) {
    return this.model.find(query);
  }

  async update(query, update) {
    return this.model.updateMany(query, { $set: update });
  }

  async delete(query) {
    return this.model.deleteMany(query);
  }
}


new CRUDService(UserModel)
