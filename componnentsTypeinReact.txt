React Fragment:

A built-in component that allows you to group multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM. It helps avoid unnecessary div wrappers.

Portal Components:

Components that allow rendering children into a DOM node outside the parent component's hierarchy. Portals are useful for scenarios like modals or tooltips.

    Components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree and log those errors or display a fallback UI. Introduced using the componentDidCatch lifecycle method.

Suspense Components:

    Components that enable declarative data fetching and rendering of fallback content while waiting for the data to arrive. Used in combination with the React.lazy function for lazy loading
